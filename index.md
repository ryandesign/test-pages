Calendar and Contacts Server
============================

The open source Calendar and Contacts Server project is a standards-compliant server implementing the CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. It provides a shared location on the network allowing multiple users to store and edit calendaring and contact information.

[CalDAV](http://caldav.calconnect.org/) is an Internet standard allowing a client to access scheduling information on a remote server. It extends the WebDAV (an HTTP-based protocol for data manipulation) specification and uses the iCalendar format for the data. The protocol is defined by [RFC 4791](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt). It allows multiple clients access to the same information thus allowing cooperative planning and information sharing. Many server and client applications support the protocol.

[CardDAV](http://carddav.calconnect.org/) is an address book client/server protocol designed to allow users to access and share contact data on a server. The CardDAV protocol is defined by [RFC 6352](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6352.txt).
